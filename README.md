## Project overview

This repository contains a complete end-to-end solution for predicting house prices from tabular data. The primary artifact is a Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/house-price-prediction.ipynb`) that implements the full pipeline:

1. Data loading & exploration
2. Cleaning & preprocessing
3. Feature engineering (numerical, categorical, interactions)
4. Model training (LightGBM + simple ensembling)
5. Validation and evaluation (RMSE)
6. Generating `submission.csv` based on `test.csv` and `sample_submission.csv`

It is intended to be a reproducible baseline you can extend for competitions or learning.

## Getting started

### Requirements

* Python 10+ recommended
* Jupyter / JupyterLab (for interactive notebook)
* Common data-science libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `lightgbm`, `xgboost`, `catboost`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tqdm`

A quick pip install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install & run

Clone the repo (or work in the existing folder), ensure data is placed under `data/` and launch the notebook:

```bash
# If you cloned
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction

# Create virtual env (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
# activate .venv (Windows)
# .venv\Scripts\activate
# activate .venv (macOS / Linux)
# source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# start jupyter and open the notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/house-price-prediction.ipynb
```

## Data

### Files provided (place them in `data/`)

* `train.csv` — training set with target column (e.g., `SalePrice`)
* `test.csv` — test set where predictions are required
* `sample_submission.csv` — sample format for submission
* `data_description.txt` — explanations of columns and data types (please read first)

> **Important:** The notebook expects these exact file names in the `data/` directory.

### Data description

Refer to `data/data_description.txt` for full feature descriptions. Typical columns include:

* `Id`: unique row identifier
* `LotArea`, `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `GrLivArea`, ... (numerical features)
* `Neighborhood`, `HouseStyle`, `Exterior1st`, `SaleCondition`, ... (categorical features)
* `SalePrice` (target in train.csv)

## Notebook & pipeline

### What the notebook does (step-by-step)

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — missing values, distributions, correlations, outliers.
2. **Preprocessing** — imputing missing values, encoding categorical variables (target/ordinal/one-hot), scaling if needed.
3. **Feature engineering** — domain-inspired features, interaction terms, aggregate statistics by group (e.g., neighborhood medians).
4. **Model training & validation** — time-insensitive K-Fold or stratified K-Fold as appropriate; computes RMSE.
5. **Ensembling & averaging** — optional blending of LightGBM / CatBoost / XGBoost runs.
6. **Final prediction & `submission.csv`** — create a versioned submission in `submissions/`.

### Feature engineering highlights

* Handle skewness of continuous features using log transformation (example for `SalePrice`).
* Create aggregated features by `Neighborhood` such as median `SalePrice`, median `GrLivArea`.
* Derive age features: `HouseAge = YrSold - YearBuilt`.
* Encode rare categories, combine low-frequency labels into `Other`.
* Interaction features (e.g., `OverallQual * GrLivArea`).

### Modeling approach

* **Primary model**: LightGBM regressor with early stopping & feature importance logging.
* **Objective**: minimize RMSE on validation folds.
* **Hyperparameter tuning**: basic grid/random search in-notebook (optional).
* **Post-processing**: clip predictions if desired and reverse any log-transform.

Example LightGBM snippet used in the notebook:

```python
from xgboost import XGBRegressor

model = XGBRegressor(
        n_estimators=1000,
        learning_rate=0.05,
        max_depth=4,
        subsample=0.8,
        colsample_bytree=0.8,
        random_state=42,
        n_jobs=-1
)
model.fit(X_train, y_train,
          eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)],
          early_stopping_rounds=200,
          verbose=100)
```

---

## Evaluation & submission

* Validation metric: **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** on log(SalePrice) or raw SalePrice depending on your preprocessing.
* Generate submission:

  ```python
  test_preds = model.predict(X_test)
  submission = pd.DataFrame({'Id': test_ids, 'SalePrice': test_preds})
  submission.to_csv('submissions/submission.csv', index=False)
  ```

---

## How to reproduce results

1. Ensure same package versions (pin dependencies in `requirements.txt`).
2. Run cells in `notebooks/house-price-prediction.ipynb` top-to-bottom (or run in JupyterLab).
3. Use fixed random seeds (seed = 42) for reproducibility in model training and data splits.
4. Keep `data/` files unchanged or document any preprocessing modifications.

---

## Tips & extensions

* Try advanced ensembling (stacking / blending) for improved leaderboard score.
* Use targeted feature selection (e.g., SHAP values) to reduce noise.
* Explore CatBoost for categorical-heavy features without heavy preprocessing.
* Incorporate external data (e.g., ZIP-level economic indicators, amenities) to boost performance.
* Add MLflow or Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Commit changes & open a PR with a description of your changes

Please keep code style consistent and include tests or example notebooks for non-trivial extensions.
